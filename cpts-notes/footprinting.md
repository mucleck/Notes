# Footprinting

## Domain information

The first point of presence on the Internet may be the `SSL certificate` from the company's main website that we can examine. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active. Another source to find more subdomains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs.

We can also output the results in JSON format.

```json
mucleck2@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .

[
  {
    "issuer_ca_id": 23451835427,
    "issuer_name": "C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R3",
    "common_name": "matomo.inlanefreight.com",
    "name_value": "matomo.inlanefreight.com",
    "id": 50815783237226155,
    "entry_timestamp": "2021-08-21T06:00:17.173",
    "not_before": "2021-08-21T05:00:16",
    "not_after": "2021-11-19T05:00:15",
    "serial_number": "03abe9017d6de5eda90"
  }...

```

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

```json
┌──(mucleck㉿vbox)-[~] curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=alcudia.net\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
 null,

vinfopol.alcudia.net

www.correu.alcudia.net
www.vinfopol.alcudia.net          
```

Next, we can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.

```bash
mucleck2@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93
inlanefreight.com 10.129.27.33
matomo.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.22
www.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.33
s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250
```

Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to the `cut` command and run them through `Shodan`.

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) can be used to find devices and systems permanently connected to the Internet like `Internet of Things` (`IoT`). It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the systems according to specific terms and criteria. For example, open HTTP or HTTPS ports and other server ports for `FTP`, `SSH`, `SNMP`, `Telnet`, `RTSP`, or `SIP` are searched. As a result, we can find devices and systems, such as `surveillance cameras`, `servers`, `smart home systems`, `industrial controllers`, `traffic lights` and `traffic controllers`, and various network components.

```bash
mucleck2@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
mucleck2@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done

Lets understand this results:

`A` records: IP’s that point to this DNS

`MX` records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company.

`NS` records: Show which service they use to solve names of ip (Very good to identify who is the host provider)

`TXT` records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376), which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent.

Third-party providers such as [domain.glass](https://domain.glass/) can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. As a positive side effect, we can also see that Cloudflare's security assessment status has been classified as "Safe". This means we have already found a security measure that can be noted for the second layer (gateway).

Another very useful provider is [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/). We can do many different searches, discover AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and even sort and filter by file format. Therefore, once we have found them through Google, we can also search for them on GrayHatWarefare and passively discover what files are stored on the given cloud storage.

## FTP

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. This connections occur via the port 21. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via TCP port 20. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process.

A distinction is made between `active` and `passive` FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the `passive mode` has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

FTP can allow anonymous acces however this can be very dangerous and so the limit of actions a user can make is often very limited by administrators.

### TFTP

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. TFTP uses UDP and does not have user authentication.

It sets limits on access based solely on the read and write permissions of a file in the operating system. Practically, this leads to TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally. Because of the lack of security, TFTP, unlike FTP, may only be used in local and protected networks. These are some commands of TFTP:

| **Commands** | **Description**                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connect`    | Sets the host to connect and if wanted, the port       |
| `get`        | Transfers files from the host to local user            |
| `put`        | Uploads a file from local to the host                  |
| `quit`       | Exits tftp                                             |
| `status`     | Shows the current status of tftp (Tons of information) |
| `verbose`    | Displays additional information                        |

Unlike FTP client, TFTP does not support directory listing (no command `ls` basically.

### Default Configuration

One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is `vsFTPd` . To install it we can run the next command:

`sudo apt install vsftpd`

The default configuration file of the client can be found in `/etc/vsftpd.conf`
